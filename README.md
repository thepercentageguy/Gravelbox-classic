# Gravelbox
The official Gravelbox - The Sandbox repository

---
I've decided to make this repository after the cancelation of Gravelbox, if i ever DO decide to work on it again, this repository **Won't** be updated!

At the beggining of the game on the splash screen there is a disclaimer saying:
> Note: This version of Gravelbox was compiled from the GitHub Repository and is not official, any bugs you may find will not be fixed as the game isn't updated anymore.

it would be nice if you kept that disclaimer.

you can do anything with this repository as long as it goes along with the [MIT License](https://github.com/BluefreddyP/Gravelbox/blob/main/LICENSE).

---
Important Note: this version of the game won't have the following things:
* Developer console
* TextMesh Pro
* Discord rich presence
* MoonSharp (unused)

This is due to the Asset store Licensing.
If you wish to use any of these, you have to import them yourself.
(TextMeshPro is required to render the UI, and other text elements)

**note: if any of these not being in the files, breaks the game, import them yourself, i won't update this to work without**
