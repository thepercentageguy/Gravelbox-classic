# Gravelbox Repository

This is the official Gravelbox repository, and this file will just contain a few notes.

---
At the start of the game there is a disclaimer that says:
> Note: this version of Gravelbox was compiled from the Official Repository, and is not official
> Any bugs you may find in this version will not be fixed by the original developer as he doesn't update the game anymore.

it'd be nice of you kept that disclaimer.

---
Anything you do with the repository is fine as long as it goes with the license.

---
if i ever do decide to work on the game again, this repository **will not** be updated.
