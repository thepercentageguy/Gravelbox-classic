# "Gravelbox: Legacy" Repository <img src="https://github.com/thepercentageguy/Gravelbox/blob/main/Assets/Sprites/gravelbox.png" alt="icon" width="30"/>

This is the official Gravelbox: Legacy repository.

---
At the start of the game there is a disclaimer that says:
> Note: this version of Gravelbox was compiled from the Official Repository, and is not official
> Any bugs you may find in this version will not be fixed by the original developer as he doesn't update the game anymore.

While i can't stop you from removing it, it'd be nice if you kept it.

---
Gravelbox is back in the form of Gravelbox: Remade
This repository will not be updated.

---
This repository doesn't come with the following things:
* TextMesh Pro
* The Developer Console
* Discord Rich Presense

This is for license reasons, you will need to import these yourself if you need/want them.

---
**note:** the game was written in Unity 2021.1.4f1
